Hello there! I'm just a guy who enjoys the complexities and challenges of data. My worldview is often guided by *Bayesian* thinking, even though I confess to occasionally falling prey to cognitive biases.

My journey into the realms of coding and statistics began a bit later in life — specifically during my university years where I studied Industrial Engineering. I ultimately pivoted towards a focus on Data Science. A dedicated reader at heart, I've naturally developed a strong interest in *Natural Language Processing*. On a lighter note, I'm a *calisthenics* aficionado — currently toying with the idea of using computer vision models to perfect my handstand form.

Presently based in Barcelona, Spain, my geographical coordinates might change in the not-so-distant future.
