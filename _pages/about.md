Hi there! I'm just someone who enjoys the complexities and challenges of data. My worldview is often guided by *Bayesian* thinking, even though I confess to occasionally falling prey to cognitive biases.

My journey into the realms of coding and statistics began during my university years while studying Industrial Engineering. My subsequent pursuit of a Master's degree cemented my focus on Data Science. As an avid reader, I've naturally cultivated a keen interest in *Natural Language Processing*. On a lighter note, I'm a *Calisthenics* amateur â€” currently toying with the idea of using computer vision models to perfect my handstand form.

Presently based in Barcelona, Spain, my geographical coordinates might change in the not-so-distant future.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to [contact](/contact/) me. Alternatively, you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ereverterlopez/).

Salut!
